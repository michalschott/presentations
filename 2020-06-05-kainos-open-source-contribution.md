# history

### more or less precise

----

Until '80 sharing source code was a common thing.

Microsoft (which now loves Linux), AT&T and other big players were boosters to start closing source codes.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Closing Unix source code caused BSD to be born.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

Not being able to modify new printer software in his laboratory, Richard Stallman has decided to create Free Software Foundation and GNU Project few years later.

There are loads of different licenses, GPL and less restricted BSD are most common used.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

free as speech, not free beer

Note:
There are projects which are based on open source solutions but they aren't free to use

###### UNIX

Note:
MacOS is not based on GNU tools! Containers to the rescue.
